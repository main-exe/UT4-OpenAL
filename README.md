# UT4-OpenAL

OpenAL audio module for Windows build of 'Unreal Tournament 4 (2014)' aka UT4.

Main benefit over default 'XAudio2' audio module is ability to experience 3D spatial audio with custom HRTF.  
In addition there are various fixes and adjustments made.

Intended to be used with **headphones** (stereo). Works with any sound card.  
The difference should be clearly noticeable as sound becomes out-of-head.

Non-native to game solutions to create 3D spatial audio for headphones is done using only 5.1/7.1 channel output and have no elevation.
Having 3D spatial sound directly from audio engine has elevation and is more accurate.  

Instructions and a way to find best sounding HRTF are included in 'Readme.txt' inside release [archive](https://github.com/main-exe/UT4-OpenAL/releases).
