# UT4-OpenAL

OpenAL audio module for Windows build of 'Unreal Tournament 4 (2014)'.

Main benefit over default 'XAudio2' audio module is ability to experience 3D spatial audio with custom HRTF.  
In addition there are various fixes and adjustments made.

Intended to be used with headphones.  
Output can be changed to speakers with 'alsoft-config' utility, but is not recommended.

Deployment instructions and a way to find best sounding HRTF are included in 'Readme.txt' inside release archive.
